      "content": "\nThe DeFi ecosystem is full of correlated assets. We see many different tokens based on ETH, for example: wstETH, wETH, aETH, cETH, \nor BTC eg: renBTC, sBTC, WBTC, aWBTC, cWBTC.\n\nIf we try to lend or stake our assets on many of the DeFi Protocols, we get a correlated asset in return.\n\nThere are multiple ways to manage risk when investing an asset. One approach is to spread your investments across multiple \nplatforms. This can be complex, and you need to understand the workflow of each platform. Another, easier way is to swap \nyour token for different ones that are based on the same core asset. This prevents complexity and extra gas fees, but \nstill ensures diversification and returns on your investments.\n\nBeing able to swap large quantities of correlated assets quickly and with minimal price slippage is a big advantage for both \ninstitutional investors and retail users in DeFi. For liquidity providers, in this case, impermanent loss is not as big of a \nconcern (except in rare cases where the depeg's happen).        ",

Constant sum invariant (x+y=k) seems to be more relevant but \ncan end the pool having just single type of tokens.\n\nStable Math's Invariant solves both of these problems and can keep prices more equal as long as the liquidity pool is \nnot extremely unbalanced\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://github.com/balancer-labs/docs-v2/raw/fc4f11145504bf9bc2dbed3ac30b6ffbe704d0aa/.gitbook/assets/output%20(1).gif\" />\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStableSwap approaches Constant Product as A->0 and Constant Sum as A->∞\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n$$\n\nA \\cdot n^n \\cdot \\sum{x_i} +D = A \\cdot D \\cdot n^n + { \\frac{D^{n+1}}{{n}^{n}\\cdot \\prod{x_i} } }\n\n$$\n\n\n<br/>\n\n Where:\n \n * $n$ is the number of tokens \n * $x_i$  is balance of token  $$i$$ \n * $$A$$ is the amplification parameter \n\nMore detail about stable math can be found [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/stable-math)\n\n## Amplification Parameter\nThe A-Factor, also known as the amplification parameter, plays a major role in how flattened the curve will be. This \nparameter controls how much slippage occurs, with higher values resulting in less slippage.\n\nIf the A-Factor is set to zero, the curve will follow a similar path to x*y=k, but with increased slippage. The \nillustration below shows the stable swap invariant with the A-Factor set to zero. Notice the green line:\n\nThe higher the A-Factor is set, the more flattened the curve becomes.\n\nWe can pass `amplificationParameter` to the constructor when creating instance of ComposableStablePool.\n",

      "content": "# ComposableStablePool\n`ComposableStablePool` This is a 5-token stable pool that also contains its own BPT. It also is a type of Balancer Pool that extends from `BasePool`, that uses the authenticate modifier to protect its functions with advanced authorization mechanisms.\n\nSome of the benefits that every pool gets when it inherits from BasePool are:\n1. Emergency Pause - The BasePool inherits from the `TemporarilyPausable` contract, which provides an emergency pause feature within the first 30 days of factory deployment.\n2. Swap Fee management - A simple but important feature is management of the swap fee percentage.\n3. Vault Integration - The Vault is the central point for all pool tokens and related bookkeeping. It is the primary point of interaction for joining, exiting, or swapping pools, and delegates to the appropriate pools as needed.\n\n## Pool Initialization\n`ComposableStablePool` uses the initialization step of Balancer Pools to mint Balancer Pool Tokens(BPT) to the first account that joins them. By minting the entire BPT supply for the initial joiner and then pulling all tokens except those due to the joiner, ComposableStablePool arrives at the desired state of the Pool holding all BPT except the joiner's.\n\n## Balancer Pool Token (BPT)\nBPT is preminted and registered as one of the tokens in the pool during initialization. This allows for token swaps to be made that look like either a single-token join or exit. ComposableStablePool also support regular joins and exits, which can create or destroy BPT.\n\nThe preminted BPT is deposited into the Vault as the initial balance of the Pool. Until it is transferred out of the Pool, it does not belong to any entity. The Pool's arithmetic acts as if BPT doesn't exist. Therefore, the total supply of BPT is not a useful value. ComposableStablePool relies on the 'virtual supply' (how much BPT is actually owned outside the Vault) instead.",

ComposableStablePool(`ComposableStablePoolRates.sol`) extends it and considers the rate provider also.",
