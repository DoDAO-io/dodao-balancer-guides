      "content": "\n## Balancer Overview\nFernando Martinelli, a well-known Brazilian entrepreneur and Maker Community member, founded Balancer. In 2018, he tested the exchange on Block as the first project of Balancer labs. In 2019, he and his technical colleague Nikolai Mushegian released the exchange's whitepaper. An Automated Market Maker (AMM) called Balancer enables customers to generate programmable liquidity. AMMs are decentralized exchanges where instead of the traditional order book method to trade assets smart contract acts as a partner in every trade. These contracts contain a cluster of tokens, called a liquidity pool. These liquidity pools ensure constant liquidity for buyers and sellers so they do not have to wait for orders to match.\n        \nKey features of Balancer DEX include\n1. **Valut** - Vault is a smart contract that controls all tokens in every balancer pool. It also serves as the gateway through which most operations in the exchange (Swaps, market entries, and exits) are carried out.\n2. **Balancer Pools** - Balancer poolsâ€™ smart contracts determine how traders exchange tokens. They allow customization and also allows anybody to create a pool\n3. **Smart Order Router (SOR)** - SOR identifies the best price for selling and buying orders in a transaction in either one or multiple liquidity pools. It increases parallel to the expansion and diversity of the Balancer pools as it gets new options to check from.\n4. **veBAL** - BAL holders/LPs should lock/stake their BAL into veBAL to get a host of benefits in the new vote-escrowed (ve) system.\n5. **Onchain Gauge System** - Since transitioning to the veModel, BAL emissions get distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT to claim BAL from liquidity mining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
