      "content": "Since transitioning to the veModel, BAL emissions get distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT to claim BAL from liquidity mining. The amount that each LP receives depends on the following:\n1. The allocation of BAL that the Pool receives\n2. The share of the LP in the Pool\n3. The boost applied to LP share based on the amount of veBAL that they hold\n\nThere are five gauge types: \n1. **Liquidity Mining Committee** - This is an allowance for the Liquidity Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from receiving it).\n2. **veBAL** - It is meant to keep locking 80/20 BPT attractive as it helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent loss risk of LPing.\n3. **Ethereum Mainnet Pools** - LM that is distributed to mainnet\n4. **Polygon Pools** - LM that is distributed to Polygon\n5. **Arbitrum Pools** - LM that is distributed to Arbitrum",
