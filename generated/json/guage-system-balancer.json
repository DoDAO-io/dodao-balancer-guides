      "content": "## Gauge System Overview\nSince transitioning to the veModel, BAL emissions get distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT to claim BAL from liquidity mining. The amount that each LP receives depends on the following:\n1. The allocation of BAL that the Pool receives\n2. The share of the LP in the Pool\n3. The boost applied to LP share based on the amount of veBAL that they hold\n\n## BAL Emissions\nCurrently the inflation is 145,000 BAL per week. Every 4 years the inflation will be halved, with gradual steps every year starting one year after the launch of the new tokenomics system. This would mean a final BAL supply of about 94,000,000 BAL.\n\nIn the Guage System, all liquidity mining BAL minted will be distributed through the gauge system. Gauges are contracts that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim BAL from liquidity mining.\n\n## Gauge Types\nThere are five gauge types: \n1. **Liquidity Mining Committee** - This is an allowance for the Liquidity Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from receiving it). This pool gets  10% of LM Rewards i.e. 14,500 BAL\n2. **veBAL** - It is meant to keep locking 80/20 BPT attractive as it helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent loss risk of LPing. This pool gets  10% of LM Rewards i.e. 14,500 BAL\n3. **Ethereum Mainnet Pools** - LM that is distributed to mainnet. This pool gets  56% of LM Rewards i.e. 81,200 BAL\n4. **Polygon Pools** - LM that is distributed to Polygon. This pool gets  17% of LM Rewards i.e. 24,650 BAL\n5. **Arbitrum Pools** - LM that is distributed to Arbitrum. This pool gets  7% of LM Rewards i.e. 10,150 BAL",

      "content": "## Background\nIn the veModel, the initial activity a large percentage of BAL emissions were directed to first the Badger pool and then later the Cream pool. This exposed a critical incentive misalignment. \n\nBalancer's most important metric is protocol revenue, but there was no direct incentive for voters to prioritize pools that generate significant revenue. If such an incentive existed and large voters ignored it in favor of their special interest pool, external players would be financially motivated to lock up veBAL and take advantage of that incentive.\n\n## Aligning pools to generate revenue \nA “core” designation is applied to the pools by  governance as part of the gauge vote approval. To be eligible, a pool must contain yield bearing tokens that Balancer earns a fee on.\n\nOn Ethereum, core pools would see any fees they generate used as bribes for them in the next cycle. On Polygon & Arbitrum, all fees earned would be used as bribes for the core pools on each network, proportionally by TVL. This will accelerate adoption of L2’s in the Balancer Ecosystem\n\nIf this initiative proves successful this process would be automated and L2 pools would be bribed based on fees generated rather than TVL\n\n## Core Pools\nCurrently, metastable pools are the only kind where Balancer earns the protocol fee on any yield generated by the underlying assets. This functionality is expected to extend to all of Balancer's pool types later this year and these future pools could be added to the gauge vote as core pools. Some key L2 pools have been included despite the fact they do not contain yield-bearing tokens - this is to begin rebuilding our L2 TVL in anticipation of the Balancer team converting these pools to yield-bearing in the near future. Thus, the starting list of core pools would be:\n\n1. wstETH/weth (Ethereum, metastable)\n2. rETH/weth (Ethereum, metastable)\n3. stMATIC/wMATIC (Polygon, metastable)\n4. MaticX/wMATIC (Polygon, metastable)\n5. USDC/wETH/wMATIC/BAL (Polygon)\n6. wETH/USDC/wBTC (Polygon)\n7. wETH/USDC/wBTC (Arbitrum)\nNote that fees earned being used as bribes is after the DAO takes their 25% cut. If we collect 40 wstETH in fees, the DAO would get 10 and 30 would be used to bribe for the wstETH pool for example.",
