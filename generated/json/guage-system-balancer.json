      "content": "## Gauge System Overview\nSince transitioning to the veModel, BAL emissions get distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT to claim BAL from liquidity mining. The amount that each LP receives depends on the following:\n1. The allocation of BAL that the Pool receives\n2. The share of the LP in the Pool\n3. The boost applied to LP share based on the amount of veBAL that they hold\n\n## BAL Emissions\nCurrently the inflation is 145,000 BAL per week. Every 4 years the inflation will be halved, with gradual steps every year starting one year after the launch of the new tokenomics system. This would mean a final BAL supply of about 94,000,000 BAL.\n\nIn the Guage System, all liquidity mining BAL minted will be distributed through the gauge system. Gauges are contracts that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim BAL from liquidity mining.\n\n## Gauge Types\nThere are five gauge types: \n1. **Liquidity Mining Committee** - This is an allowance for the Liquidity Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from receiving it). This pool gets  10% of LM Rewards i.e. 14,500 BAL\n2. **veBAL** - It is meant to keep locking 80/20 BPT attractive as it helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent loss risk of LPing. This pool gets  10% of LM Rewards i.e. 14,500 BAL\n3. **Ethereum Mainnet Pools** - LM that is distributed to mainnet. This pool gets  56% of LM Rewards i.e. 81,200 BAL\n4. **Polygon Pools** - LM that is distributed to Polygon. This pool gets  17% of LM Rewards i.e. 24,650 BAL\n5. **Arbitrum Pools** - LM that is distributed to Arbitrum. This pool gets  7% of LM Rewards i.e. 10,150 BAL",
