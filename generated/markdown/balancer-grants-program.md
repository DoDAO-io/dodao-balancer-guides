## Balancer Grants


## Overview

# **Overview**

Balancer is a Protocol built on Ethereum that works as an automated portfolio management and trading platform where fees are collected from traders to rebalance portfolios by leveraging arbitrage opportunities. 

Also, as a community-driven organization, Balancer’s governance process is decentralized and is operated by members of the community who hold the governance token. For Balancer, the governance token is veBAL (locked B-80BAL-20WETH) and is used for every decision-making process within the organization.

Governance points groups or individuals to provide services to the protocol, who must bring forward a proposal through the Balancer Forum for discussion and voting (Snapshot). These SPs (Service Providers) present a long-term commitment to the protocol and a broad scope of work. The proposal must also include the team's credentials, expected metrics and KPIs (key performance indicators).

## Balancer Grants

# **Balancer Grants**

Balancer Grants is a committee that runs an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP) under the DAO operating framework. 

The grants program provides support and funding to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects.

The Grants Committee is a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors.

## Applications

# **Applications**

For Q4/2022, Balancer Grants has 95,000 BAL in funds to support and fund projects that are willing to build on Balancer and develop the Balancer ecosystem.

But what does a successful grant submission look like?

You can find more information on how to build your application [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zFKt8QHfcuea_ltUsTtv0v6kc5IfAbnGC9PUcCaiCQ0/edit), and encourage you to browse through [Grants' RFPs, challenges and opportunities](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/RFPs-Challenges-Opportunities-cb39201b792c4483b90732192390a556).

For starters, think on how your project can provide value to the Balancer ecosystem. Will it increase TVL on Balancer Protocol? Can it incite more projects to build on top of Balancer? Does it create internal growth and value?

If you have a good idea, please bring it forward! 

The Committee will respond within 2 weeks through email.

Note that any proposals regarding educational material for trading in Balancer pools, general DeFi onboarding, event sponsorships etc. are best directed trough Marketing, which is not directly under the scope of Grants, but would best be presented to [Orb Collective](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-20-funding-proposal-for-orb-collective/3359/17).

## Rewards

# **Rewards**

The payments are made in installments based on a predefined agreement between the Grantee and Grants Committee to ensure that milestones are achieved and the risk of not completing the task is minimized.

Applications must set a total amount required to successfully deliver the project, and propose a payment breakdown. Milestones and tranches need to be set up in a way that makes sense for both parties. Detail out deliverables for each milestone and their planned duration.

Aside from funding, contributors get support in terms of access to mentors who work with them to ensure that the projects go on successfully and in cases of challenges, they will be able to resolve with the help of the mentors.

## Abandoned Grant

# **Abandoned Grant**

If a Grantee has ignored Committee messages for 6 weeks, we consider the grant stale/abandoned. To make sure we do not have endless clutter within our pipeline, this would be the moment to take it out of our projected budget and weekly/monthly updates. 

To prevent situations like the above from happening, the Grants co-leads ask mentors to do monthly update calls with teams and keep a finger on the pulse by having weekly Telegram updates. If however it does occur, the Grantee will be given a warning after 4 weeks and reminder after 5. 

After the deadline has crossed and no further contact has been established, the Grantee gets removed from the live grants within the internal documentation and also from the [live grantee page](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9).

If a Grantee re-emerges and shows signs of wanting to continue their grant after it got declared ‘stale’, the Grantee will have to resubmit a grant application.
