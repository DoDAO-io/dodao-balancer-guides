## Intro to Balancer AMM


## Introduction


## Balancer Intro
Fernando Martinelli, a well-known Brazilian entrepreneur and Maker Community member, founded Balancer. In 2018, he tested the exchange on Block as the first project of Balancer labs. In 2019, he and his technical colleague Nikolai Mushegian released the exchange's whitepaper. An Automated Market Maker (AMM) called Balancer enables customers to generate programmable liquidity. AMMs are decentralized exchanges where instead of the traditional order book method to trade assets smart contract acts as a partner in every trade. These contracts contain a cluster of tokens, called a liquidity pool. These liquidity pools ensure constant liquidity for buyers and sellers so they do not have to wait for orders to match.
