      ## Balancer Overview

      Fernando Martinelli, a well-known Brazilian entrepreneur and Maker
      Community member, founded Balancer. In 2018, he tested the exchange on
      Block as the first project of Balancer labs. In 2019, he and his technical
      colleague Nikolai Mushegian released the exchange's whitepaper. An
      Automated Market Maker (AMM) called Balancer enables customers to generate
      programmable liquidity. AMMs are decentralized exchanges where instead of
      the traditional order book method to trade assets smart contract acts as a
      partner in every trade. These contracts contain a cluster of tokens,
      called a liquidity pool. These liquidity pools ensure constant liquidity
      for buyers and sellers so they do not have to wait for orders to match.
              
      Key features of Balancer DEX include

      1. **Valut** - Vault is a smart contract that controls all tokens in every
      balancer pool. It also serves as the gateway through which most operations
      in the exchange (Swaps, market entries, and exits) are carried out.

      2. **Balancer Pools** - Balancer pools’ smart contracts determine how
      traders exchange tokens. They allow customization and also allows anybody
      to create a pool

      3. **Smart Order Router (SOR)** - SOR identifies the best price for
      selling and buying orders in a transaction in either one or multiple
      liquidity pools. It increases parallel to the expansion and diversity of
      the Balancer pools as it gets new options to check from.

      4. **veBAL** - BAL holders/LPs should lock/stake their BAL into veBAL to
      get a host of benefits in the new vote-escrowed (ve) system.

      5. **Onchain Gauge System** - Since transitioning to the veModel, BAL
      emissions get distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs
      (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT to claim BAL from liquidity
      mining.

      The Vault is the smart contract used by Balancer. It is the smart contract
      that manages and holds all the tokens in a Balancer pool. It is also the
      portal through which most Balancer operations occur. It also separates
      accounting and token management from the pool logic. This architecture
      unifies several pool layouts under one roof; the Vault is agnostic to pool
      math and can support any system that meets a few criteria. This allows
      smart contracts much simpler as they now play a minor part in managing
      funds. If you have a great idea for a new trading system, you can create a
      custom pool that taps into Balancer's existing liquidity. This means you
      don't have to build your own decentralized exchange (DEX).


      Furthermore, other decentralized pools' token accounting is paired with
      pool logic which makes multi-hop trading quite costly since ERC-20 has to
      be transferred at each hop. Balancer gains an advantage here since it
      stores all its tokens under one contract, The Vault. This difference
      allows for much greater swapping efficiency. Rather than transferring
      tokens on each step of a multi-hop trade, it only keeps internal records
      of which pool is holding what, transferring tokens only at the input and
      output steps. This reduction in token transfers makes the entire process
      highly gas efficient. Additionally, The Vault keeps track of the balances
      for arbitrary Ethereum addresses. Users have access to the Vault where
      they can store Internal Balances and make trades to/from them.

      Pools are the foundation of the Balancer Protocol and smart contracts that
      through which traders can swap between tokens on Balancer. What makes
      Balancer pools unique is their limitless flexibility; other exchanges have
      pools with constrained parameters, but Balancer can accommodate any
      composition or underlying math. This flexibility opens the door for
      customized pricing functions in trading pools.


      ## Weighted Pools

      Balancer has about 1500 shared liquidity pools users can join. These pools
      can carry up to 8 assets and can have ratios other than the conventional
      50-50 split. They range in size with the largest over a $37 million market
      cap. These pools use weighted maths and are called Weighted Pools.
      Weighted pools offer users the ability to choose their level of exposure
      to certain assets while still providing liquidity. This makes them a great
      choice for investors who want to diversify their portfolios without
      sacrificing liquidity. The higher a token's weight in a pool, the less
      impermanent loss it will experience in the event of a price surge. For
      example, [the Oracle Weighted
      Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56000200000000000000000014)
      with 80/20 ratio of BAL and WETH respectively. 



      ## Stable Pools

      Stable Pools are created especially for assets like various stablecoins
      that are anticipated to regularly trade at close to parity. These use
      Stable Math (based on StableSwap, popularized by Curve) which allows for
      significantly larger trades before encountering substantial price impact,
      vastly increasing capital efficiency for like-kind swaps. These pools
      encounter lower price impacts. Since the stable pools are plugged into all
      the other pools on balancer swapping between stablecoins is frequently
      used for arbitrage when one token is paired with two different stable
      coins in different pools. The two largest stable tokens in use are for USD
      stablecoins and tokens that track Bitcoin that are
      [staBAL3-USD](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063)
      composed of DAI/USDC/USDT and
      [staBAL3-BTC](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xfeadd389a5c427952d8fdb8057d6c8ba1156cc56000000000000000000000066)
      composed of WBTC/renBTC/sBTC.



      ## Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools

      LBPs, or Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, are pools that have the ability to
      dynamically alter token weighting. Weighted Math with time-dependent
      weights is used in LBPs. The pool owner determines the starting and ending
      weights and times. The pool owner also has the authority to suspend swaps.
      This allows the users to incur less impermanent loss and allows the market
      to find the appropriate price for the new token. Liquidity bootstrapping
      pools are one of the most successful ways to launch a new token. The
      purpose of [Gitcoin's
      LBP](https://fjordfoundry.com/pools/mainnet/0xC065798F227b49C150bCDC6CDc43149A12c4d757),
      which is made up of AKITA and WETH, is to gradually return the Akita owned
      by the company (as given to it by Vitalik) to the community. When
      executing a slow sale with ongoing pressure, using an LBP is helpful. An
      example of LBP is
      [70/30/DAI/Temple](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xf88278315a1d5ace3aaa41712f60602e069208e6000200000000000000000375)
      pool



      ## MetaStable Pools

      MetaStable Pools are an extension of Stable Pools that contain tokens with
      known exchange rates. Stable Math is used in conjunction with this
      established exchange rate in MetaStable Pools. They are great with tokens
      highly correlated but not pegged prices. For example, DAI/cDAI have a very
      strong correlation, but cDAI slowly accumulates lending fees by lending
      DAI to the Compound protocol and appreciates relative to DAI.  For
      example, Balancer MetaStable pools are ideal for the wstETH-WETH pair as
      the stETH asset is highly correlated but not pegged 1:1 to ETH as it
      accrues staking returns.



      ## Managed Pools

      Managed Pools, which employ Weighted Math, let users create pools with a
      maximum of 50 tokens. These pools contain time-based weight-shifting
      methods akin to Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, giving a framework for fund
      managers. These pools are feature rich. Features include Pool Managers,
      active token management, etc. WSBDapp is utilizing Balancer's Managed
      Pools to bring decentralized finance to their users. This allows their
      investors to participate in pools created and operated by the WSBDapp Team
      using the technology and control only available on Balancer.



      ## Boosted Pools

      Boosted Pools offer the best of both worlds to Liquidity Providers and
      Swappers. Swappers can access deep stablecoin liquidity with near-parity
      exchange rates, while Liquidity Providers can have their liquidity
      positions sent to external protocols, such as Aave. This is a great way
      for both groups to get what they need and make the most out of their
      situation. These variations of stable pools instead contain the pool
      tokens of nested linear pools, which, in the case of the Aave example,
      maintain the correct balances of TOKEN and aTOKEN.

      ## veBAL

      In April 2022, Balancer adopted the vote escrowed model (veModel). Under
      this model, users who lock their veBAL tokens for a longer period of time
      have more voting rights in the Protocol. 


      Instead of pure BAL, BPT of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool can be locked into
      veBAL, similar to how CRV can be locked into veCRV. This has the big
      advantage of keeping BAL liquid as well as setting a precedent for other
      teams to do the same with their 80/20 Balancer pools. Alternatives to
      veBAL have been considered, like vebptBAL. The simplicity of veBAL — even
      though what is locked is not pure BAL — has however been the preferred
      option.


      Users who invest in the BAL/WETH 80/20 Pool are rewarded with BPT
      (Balancer Pool Token). veBAL lockers also receive 75% of protocol fees. In
      addition to 75% of protocol revenues, veBAL holders also get 10% of all
      BAL minted weekly.


      This means that:

      1. BAL holders should lock their BAL into veBAL to get a host of benefits
      in the new vote-escrowed (ve) system.

      2. Balancer LPs should stake their LP Tokens (BPTs, Balancer Pool Tokens)
      to continue to receive liquidity mining incentives


      The new veBAL system has the following benefits

      - Long-term alignment: By locking BPT, token holders will be encouraged to
      support Balancer over the long-term instead of speculating short-term.

      - Predictability: Fully automated BAL minting and inflation schedule
      locked forever.

      - Protocol revenue distribution: 75% of all fees generated by the protocol
      are proportionally distributed to veBAL holders. In addition to 75% of
      protocol revenues, veBAL holders also get 10% of all BAL minted weekly.

      - Plug & play compatibility with Curve’s ecosystem: it's expected that
      many protocols and products built on top of Curve's ve system will also
      launch on top of veBAL given the contracts have been kept the same.

      ## Gauge System Overview

      Since transitioning to the veModel, BAL emissions get distributed through
      the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their
      BPT to claim BAL from liquidity mining. The amount that each LP receives
      depends on the following:

      1. The allocation of BAL that the Pool receives

      2. The share of the LP in the Pool

      3. The boost applied to LP share based on the amount of veBAL that they
      hold


      ## BAL Emissions

      Currently the inflation is 145,000 BAL per week. Every 4 years the
      inflation will be halved, with gradual steps every year starting one year
      after the launch of the new tokenomics system. This would mean a final BAL
      supply of about 94,000,000 BAL.


      In the Guage System, all liquidity mining BAL minted will be distributed
      through the gauge system. Gauges are contracts that allow LPs (liquidity
      providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim
      BAL from liquidity mining.


      ## Gauge Types

      There are five gauge types: 

      1. **Liquidity Mining Committee** - This is an allowance for the Liquidity
      Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer
      protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue
      veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee
      should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL
      for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from
      receiving it). This pool gets  10% of LM Rewards i.e. 14,500 BAL

      2. **veBAL** - It is meant to keep locking 80/20 BPT attractive as it
      helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent
      loss risk of LPing. This pool gets  10% of LM Rewards i.e. 14,500 BAL

      3. **Ethereum Mainnet Pools** - LM that is distributed to mainnet. This
      pool gets  56% of LM Rewards i.e. 81,200 BAL

      4. **Polygon Pools** - LM that is distributed to Polygon. This pool gets 
      17% of LM Rewards i.e. 24,650 BAL

      5. **Arbitrum Pools** - LM that is distributed to Arbitrum. This pool
      gets  7% of LM Rewards i.e. 10,150 BAL
