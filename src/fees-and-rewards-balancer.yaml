      There are a few different types of fees on Balancer, each one collected in
      order to support a healthy ecosystem. For example, Liquidity Providers
      collect swap fees from users who trade with pools; this acts as an
      incentive for them to continue providing liquidity, which helps facilitate
      trades.        


      ## Swap Fees

      When traders use a pool to trade, they pay swap fees. For pools that
      inherit from BasePool, these fees can be customized with a minimum value
      of 0.0001% and a maximum value of 10%. 


      The fees go to Liquidity Providers in exchange for them putting their
      tokens in the pool to facilitate trades. Trade fees are collected at the
      time of a swap, and it goes directly into the pool, growing the pool's
      balance


      ## Protocol Fees 

      Protocol Fees are a percentage of swap fees collected by pools. These go
      to the DAO Treasury to be used or held as the DAO sees fit. At deployment,
      Protocol Fees for swaps were set to 0%. These fees were activated by a
      governance vote and were later raised to 50% by a subsequent proposal. For
      the most up-to-date protocol fee data, please call
      `getSwapFeePercentage()` on the ProtocolFeesCollector contract.


      For example, if a pool has a 1% swap fee, and there was a 10% protocol
      swap fee, 0.9% of each trade would be collected for the LPs, and 0.1%
      would be collected to the protocol fee collector contract.


      ## Static and Dynamic Fees

      At the time of pool creation, the pool creator defines the fee and the
      owner. If the owner is set to an uncontrolled address (typically the zero
      address) then the swap fee is static. If the owner sets it to a controlled
      address, that address can set the fee at will, therefore making the swap
      fee dynamic.


      ## Flash Loan Fees

      Flash Loan fees are a type of Protocol Fee on Balancer. The fees collected
      as interest on flash loans go to the DAO Treasury.

      ## Rewards for Liquidity Providers

      Swap fees go to Liquidity Providers in exchange for them putting their
      tokens in the pool to facilitate trades. Trade fees are collected at the
      time of a swap, and it goes directly into the pool, growing the pool's
      balance


      Along with the Swap fees, eligible pools also get Liquidity Mining rewards
      based on the new Gauge System

      The amount received by each LP will depend on:

      1. How much the pool they are providing liquidity to receives

      2. What share of the poolâ€™s liquidity they have


      They can also get their rewards boosted by securing veBAL


      ## Rewards for veBAL Holders

      **veBAL** - After locking the 80/20 BAL/ETH BPT, the user have a non-zero
      balance of veBAL and will be able to help govern Balancer protocol, also
      benefiting from other rewards.


      * 75% of protocol revenues collected by the protocol fee collector gets
      distributed to veBAL holders. The other 25% of the fees will be kept by
      the DAO treasury as a reserve.


      * Also 10% of the BAL minted every week i.e. 14,500 BAL goes to the veBAL
      holders.  It helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the
      impermanent loss risk of LPing 


      * veBAL holders can also claim Bribes from
      https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer


      ## Rewards for Liquidity Providers with veBAL

      The veBAL system implements a multiplier based upon the time locking
      mechanism. Locking the same amount of BPT for a longer period will yield a
      higher incentive multiplier for a user.


      The maximum boost possible for liquidity mining incentives is 2.5x. For
      tooling, calculate your boost [here](https://balancer.tools/boost).
