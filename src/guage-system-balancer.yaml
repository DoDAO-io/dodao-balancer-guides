      ## Gauge System Overview

      Since transitioning to the veModel, BAL emissions get distributed through
      the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their
      BPT to claim BAL from liquidity mining. The amount that each LP receives
      depends on the following:

      1. The allocation of BAL that the Pool receives

      2. The share of the LP in the Pool

      3. The boost applied to LP share based on the amount of veBAL that they
      hold


      ## BAL Emissions

      Currently the inflation is 145,000 BAL per week. Every 4 years the
      inflation will be halved, with gradual steps every year starting one year
      after the launch of the new tokenomics system. This would mean a final BAL
      supply of about 94,000,000 BAL.


      In the Guage System, all liquidity mining BAL minted will be distributed
      through the gauge system. Gauges are contracts that allow LPs (liquidity
      providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim
      BAL from liquidity mining.


      ## Gauge Types

      There are five gauge types: 

      1. **Liquidity Mining Committee** - This is an allowance for the Liquidity
      Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer
      protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue
      veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee
      should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL
      for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from
      receiving it). This pool gets  10% of LM Rewards i.e. 14,500 BAL

      2. **veBAL** - It is meant to keep locking 80/20 BPT attractive as it
      helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent
      loss risk of LPing. This pool gets  10% of LM Rewards i.e. 14,500 BAL

      3. **Ethereum Mainnet Pools** - LM that is distributed to mainnet. This
      pool gets  56% of LM Rewards i.e. 81,200 BAL

      4. **Polygon Pools** - LM that is distributed to Polygon. This pool gets 
      17% of LM Rewards i.e. 24,650 BAL

      5. **Arbitrum Pools** - LM that is distributed to Arbitrum. This pool
      gets  7% of LM Rewards i.e. 10,150 BAL

      ## Background

      In the veModel, the initial activity a large percentage of BAL emissions
      were directed to first the Badger pool and then later the Cream pool. This
      exposed a critical incentive misalignment. 


      Balancer's most important metric is protocol revenue, but there was no
      direct incentive for voters to prioritize pools that generate significant
      revenue. If such an incentive existed and large voters ignored it in favor
      of their special interest pool, external players would be financially
      motivated to lock up veBAL and take advantage of that incentive.


      ## Aligning pools to generate revenue 

      A “core” designation is applied to the pools by  governance as part of the
      gauge vote approval. To be eligible, a pool must contain yield bearing
      tokens that Balancer earns a fee on.


      On Ethereum, core pools would see any fees they generate used as bribes
      for them in the next cycle. On Polygon & Arbitrum, all fees earned would
      be used as bribes for the core pools on each network, proportionally by
      TVL. This will accelerate adoption of L2’s in the Balancer Ecosystem


      If this initiative proves successful this process would be automated and
      L2 pools would be bribed based on fees generated rather than TVL


      ## Core Pools

      Currently, metastable pools are the only kind where Balancer earns the
      protocol fee on any yield generated by the underlying assets. This
      functionality is expected to extend to all of Balancer's pool types later
      this year and these future pools could be added to the gauge vote as core
      pools. Some key L2 pools have been included despite the fact they do not
      contain yield-bearing tokens - this is to begin rebuilding our L2 TVL in
      anticipation of the Balancer team converting these pools to yield-bearing
      in the near future. Thus, the starting list of core pools would be:


      1. wstETH/weth (Ethereum, metastable)

      2. rETH/weth (Ethereum, metastable)

      3. stMATIC/wMATIC (Polygon, metastable)

      4. MaticX/wMATIC (Polygon, metastable)

      5. USDC/wETH/wMATIC/BAL (Polygon)

      6. wETH/USDC/wBTC (Polygon)

      7. wETH/USDC/wBTC (Arbitrum)

      Note that fees earned being used as bribes is after the DAO takes their
      25% cut. If we collect 40 wstETH in fees, the DAO would get 10 and 30
      would be used to bribe for the wstETH pool for example.
